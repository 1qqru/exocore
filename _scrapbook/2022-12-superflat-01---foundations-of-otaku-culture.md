# SUPERFLAT: Foundations of Modern Otaku Culture

## Movies

Chronological collection of films referenced in a variety of sources on the subject and picks which I personally think are signifiers of the concept.

>Just on the border of your waking mind,
There lies another time.
Where darkness and light are one,
And as you tread the halls of sanity,
You feel so glad to be unable to go beyond.
I have a message from another time.

### Post-War Japanese Constitution

The post-war Japanese constitution was heavily influenced by the United States, as Japan was occupied by American forces following World War II. The constitution was intended to promote democracy and prevent the rise of militarism and authoritarianism in Japan.

One of the most significant aspects of the constitution was the renunciation of war and the prohibition of the maintenance of armed forces. Article 9 of the constitution states that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." This article effectively disarmed Japan and prevented it from engaging in military aggression.

However, the United States maintained a significant military presence in Japan, and the Japanese government was eventually allowed to establish a self-defense force. This force was limited in size and capabilities, and was not intended for offensive operations.

The post-war Japanese constitution has faced criticism for being imposed by the United States, and some have argued that it hinders Japan's ability to defend itself in an increasingly volatile international environment. However, others have praised the constitution for promoting peace and democracy in Japan.

Japanese author Yukio Mishima was a vocal critic of the post-war Japanese constitution and its pacifist stance. In his writings, Mishima argued that the constitution emasculated the Japanese people and weakened the nation. He believed that Japan should reclaim its martial spirit and rebuild its military in order to defend itself against foreign threats. In Mishima's word, “The Constitution is telling Japanese people to die.”

This constitution changed the Japanese psyche and forced the people of japan into mindset of submission to America. It is presented that the renunciation of war and the prohibition of the maintenance of armed forces has led to a culture of non-violence and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Well, kind of...[^1]

[^1]: The post-war Japanese constitution's Article 9, which renounces war and prohibits the maintenance of armed forces, has long been a source of debate and controversy. However, in recent years, the article has been reinterpreted to allow for Japan's participation in warfare alongside the United States.

    This reinterpretation came to the forefront during the Iraq War, when Japan sent a self-defense force to provide non-combat support to American forces. This marked a significant shift in Japan's pacifist stance, and raised questions about the limitations of Article 9.

    Critics argue that this reinterpretation undermines the spirit of the constitution and puts Japan at risk of being drawn into conflicts that do not directly threaten its security. They argue that Japan should remain committed to its pacifist principles and avoid involvement in foreign wars.

    Supporters of the reinterpretation, on the other hand, argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in international security, particularly in light of the growing threat from North Korea and China. They argue that Japan must be willing to defend itself and its allies, and that the self-defense force is capable of doing so without violating the constitution.
