# SUPERFLAT: Foundations of Modern Otaku Culture

## Essential Content

Chronological collection of media referenced in a variety of sources on the subject and picks which I personally think are signifiers of the concept.

>Just on the border of your waking mind,
There lies another time.
Where darkness and light are one,
And as you tread the halls of sanity,
You feel so glad to be unable to go beyond.
I have a message from another time.

### Post-War Japanese Constitution

The post-war Japanese constitution was heavily influenced by the United States, as Japan was occupied by American forces following World War II. The constitution was intended to promote democracy and prevent the rise of militarism and authoritarianism in Japan.

One of the most significant aspects of the constitution was the renunciation of war and the prohibition of the maintenance of armed forces. Article 9 of the constitution states that "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." This article effectively disarmed Japan and prevented it from engaging in military aggression.

However, the United States maintained a significant military presence in Japan, and the Japanese government was eventually allowed to establish a self-defense force. This force was limited in size and capabilities, and was not intended for offensive operations.

The post-war Japanese constitution has faced criticism for being imposed by the United States, and some have argued that it hinders Japan's ability to defend itself in an increasingly volatile international environment. However, others have praised the constitution for promoting peace and democracy in Japan.

Japanese author Yukio Mishima was a vocal critic of the post-war Japanese constitution and its pacifist stance. In his writings, Mishima argued that the constitution emasculated the Japanese people and weakened the nation. He believed that Japan should reclaim its martial spirit and rebuild its military in order to defend itself against foreign threats. In Mishima's word, “The Constitution is telling Japanese people to die.”

This constitution changed the Japanese psyche and forced the people of japan into mindset of submission to America. It is presented that the renunciation of war and the prohibition of the maintenance of armed forces has led to a culture of non-violence and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Well, kind of...[^1]



### Historiography of Otaku

The film Daicon IV is a celebration of otaku culture, captured in a beautiful five-minute 8mm masterpiece. Set at the 1981 "Osaka Science Fiction Convention" - an event for fans of anime and science fiction - it showcases the boundless possibilities of the imagination and the power of storytelling.

Fuelled by a love for science fiction, the rise of otaku culture was marked by the emergence of "robot anime" and tokusatsu - special effects-driven tales that drew inspiration from the West. The classic anime Mobile Suit Gundam, for example, was influenced by Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers. Before the term "otaku" entered the public consciousness, these devoted fans of anime and tokusatsu found solace in the fantastical worlds of science fiction, and the Daicon films were their shining beacon. Like a guiding light in the darkness, these works illuminated the burgeoning otaku movement, offering a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of the imagination.

The Daicon animations were created by a group of talented young individuals, including the legendary figures Toshio Okada, Yasuhiro Takeda, and Hideaki Anno. These visionaries would go on to play a crucial role in the birth of Gainax, the studio behind the iconic anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. But in those days, they were simply college students in the Osaka region, driven by their passion for anime and science fiction. The Daicon films were their calling cards, showcasing their incredible talent and laying the groundwork for the otaku movement that would sweep across Japan.

The Daicon animations are a testament to the spirit of the first generation of otakus. These films are bursting with references to the elements of pop culture that would come to define otaku culture - from Godzilla and Space Battleship Yamato, to Ultraman and western superheroes. But beyond their playful nods to the subculture, the Daicon films also showcase a relentless pursuit of quality and sophistication. It is this combination of whimsy and refinement that set the stage for the evolution of a mere science-fiction-centric subculture into a vibrant and thriving otaku subculture. Today, the spirit of the Daicon animations lives on, inspiring fans and creators alike to embrace the boundless possibilities of the imagination.

The Daicon movies are an enormous labour of love, showcasing a level of passion and dedication that is truly remarkable. Created as the opening event of an amateur competition, these films demonstrate the incredible potential of the otaku movement and the boundless possibilities of the imagination. The attention to detail, the sheer amount of references to popular culture, and the relentless pursuit of quality and sophistication make the Daicon movies a true masterpiece and a testament to the spirit of otaku culture.

The ending of the Daicon films is a powerful and poignant moment, capturing the essence of otaku culture and the spirit of the early movement. In a brilliant explosion of pink and Japan's national flower, the world comes to an end, only to be resurrected by the Spaceship DAICON - a symbol of the otaku community and its unyielding hope and optimism. As the characters come together to celebrate the restoration of the planet, the films showcase the boundless curiosity, extreme sentimentalism, and inherent affirmation of hope that define otaku culture. These qualities are reminiscent of movements like the hippie movement, highlighting an immanent connection between the early otaku movement and broader cultural movements of the time. The ending of the Daicon films is a true masterpiece, full of beauty and sensitivity, and a powerful reminder of the enduring spirit of otaku culture.

The 1970 World Exposition in Osaka was a pivotal moment for the early otaku community, offering a glimpse into a future of peace, progress, and harmony. With the theme of "Progress and Harmony of Mankind", Expo '70 showcased a utopia of technological advancement and space exploration, free from the constraints of nations and borders. For the young otakus in attendance, this vision of the future was incredibly inspiring, offering a sense of hope and possibility in the aftermath of the trauma of war.

But as the exposition came to an end, the dream of this utopia faded away, leaving otakus clinging to their forgotten hopes and dreams. Despite the disappointment, otakus continued to hold onto their belief in the power of their dreams, even as they were betrayed and left bitter by the reality of the world around them. Over time, otaku culture became defined by this excess of belief and the bitterness that followed its betrayal.

With time, the otaku community became sustained by feelings of dissociation, a world of micro-realities and alternate universes that exist only in the hearts and minds of its members. This way of life is perhaps best understood through the lens of schizotypal personality disorder, characterized by a disconnection from reality and an intense focus on one's own inner world. Otakus are driven by a need to escape the constraints of the outside world, finding solace and solvency in the imaginative worlds they create. It is this dissociation, this disconnection from the world around them, that defines contemporary otaku culture and sets it apart from the mainstream. It is a world of hidden depths and hidden meanings, a world of beauty and tragedy, a world of wonder and despair. The otaku is only capable of self-involved communication, or as Asuka would say, “disgusting”.

## Gatekeeping: Degeneracy as self-defense and Otaku as an anticulture 

As the otaku cling to their individual tastes and interests, they form tight-knit communities based on a shared obsession with their chosen subculture. However, this obsession can also lead to a form of gatekeeping, where only those who possess a deep knowledge and understanding of the micro-realities of the otaku world are accepted. Those who do not meet these standards are rejected and ostracized. This insular behaviour can give the impression of a cult-like devotion to their subculture, with a reverence for the obscure and esoteric knowledge that only true otaku possess. In this way, the otaku guard the purity of their subculture, protecting it from the outside world and preserving its unique identity.

Despite their dedication to their subculture, however, the otaku also face a sense of isolation and disconnection from mainstream society. Their intense focus on their individual interests can make it difficult for them to form meaningful connections with those outside of their community, leading to a feeling of alienation and loneliness. This isolation can also fuel their devotion to their subculture, as it becomes a source of comfort and belonging in a world that often feels hostile and unaccepting. In this way, the otaku subculture becomes a refuge, a safe haven where they can celebrate their individuality and embrace their passions without fear of judgment.

The otaku subculture has its roots in the obsession with collecting and analysing information about anime, manga, and other forms of popular culture. This obsession led to a radicalization of the critical analysis of these forms of entertainment, with the otaku becoming experts in the minutiae of their chosen subculture. They poured over every detail, dissecting and analyzing every aspect of their favorite shows and comics, seeking to uncover hidden meanings and secrets that others might have missed. This intense focus on accumulating knowledge and understanding became a defining characteristic of the otaku subculture, with many members becoming known for their encyclopedic knowledge of their chosen field. As a result, the otaku came to be seen as experts and authorities on their subculture, respected and admired within their community for their depth of knowledge and passion.

But even if an intellectual hierarchy seemed present within the otaku community, the otaku was seen by the average Japanese as a pathetic and pitiful figure, isolated from mainstream society and consumed by their obsessions. Their dedication to their subculture was viewed as a form of degeneracy, a failure to conform to the norms and expectations of Japanese society. This perception of the otaku was often reinforced by the media, which tends to portray them as socially awkward and out of touch with reality [^2](add reference to famous cases like cannibal otaku and otaku train sarin gas stuff). As a result, the otaku were often ostracized and marginalized, viewed as a blight on Japanese society and a source of shame. 

That until the unexpected happened. They integrated the mainstream.

As the otaku subculture grew and evolved, it began to shed its reputation as a marginalized and ostracized group. The latest generation of otaku was no longer content to remain isolated in their insular communities, and instead sought to expand their influence and reach. This led to a proliferation of otaku culture, with anime, manga, and other forms of entertainment becoming increasingly mainstream and popular. As the otaku subculture grew in popularity, it began to lose its association with social disdain and instead became a mainstream part of Japanese culture. Recently this process was accelerated by the success of Studio Ghibli, which won an Academy Award and helped to bring anime to an even wider audience. (The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009, today in 2022 the anime market for the United States is worth approximately $25 billion.) As a result, the otaku subculture became "normified," at least on the surface, with its members no longer seen as outcasts but instead as part of the cultural mainstream.

Despite its mainstream acceptance, the otaku subculture still maintains its outsider status, with many of its members continuing to explore the fringes of Japanese society. This outsider perspective has allowed the otaku to develop a unique and often provocative approach to art, culture, and entertainment. In this way, the otaku subculture has come to be seen as an "anticulture," rejecting the norms and values of mainstream society in favor of its own unique vision. This anticultural approach has led the otaku to embrace the strange and the taboo, creating works of art and entertainment that are both shocking and thought-provoking. As the otaku subculture continues to evolve, it will likely continue to challenge and subvert the expectations of the mainstream, pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable and acceptable in pursuit of its own unique vision.

### Pushing the Overton Window: Doujinshi, Lolicon, Hentai and Imageboards

The otaku subculture has played a significant role in pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable and acceptable in Japanese society. Through their embrace of the grotesque, their rejection of traditional gender norms, and their exploration of niche and specialized forms of art and entertainment, the otaku have challenged the norms and expectations of the mainstream, helping to shift the so-called "Overton window" and open up new possibilities for expression.

One of the key ways that the otaku have pushed the Overton window is through the development of doujinshi culture. Doujinshi, also known as fan fiction, is a form of art and entertainment created by fans of existing works of art and entertainment. This form of post-authorship, as it has been described by Deleuzian philosophers, allows for the creation of new and unique works of art and entertainment that challenge the traditional notion of authorship and ownership. The popularity of doujinshi has helped to legitimize this form of expression, making it more acceptable and acceptable within the cultural mainstream.

Another way that the otaku have pushed the Overton window is through the embrace of lolicon and hentai. These forms of manga and anime, which feature explicit sexual content and violence, are often considered shocking and transgressive by mainstream standards. However, for many otaku, these forms of expression provide a sense of protection and shield against the total cannibalization of otaku culture by the capital. By embracing degeneracy and shock value, the otaku are able to assert their individuality and independence, refusing to be subsumed by the dominant cultural forces.

Overall, the importance of imageboards and imageboard culture to otaku culture cannot be understated. Imageboards, such as 4chan and 2channel, provide a space for otaku to share and discuss their interests and passions in a free and open manner. These imageboards allow for the creation of rhizomatic networks of connection and communication, fostering a sense of community and belonging among the otaku.

## Superflat

### Takeshi Murakami's view on the concept

Takeshi Murakami is a Japanese artist who is known for his exploration of the concept of "superflatness" in his work. Superflatness is a term that Murakami coined to describe the aesthetic and cultural phenomenon of Japanese society, which he sees as being characterized by a lack of depth and a flattening of meaning.

According to Murakami, the concept of superflatness is rooted in the history and culture of Japan. He argues that Japanese society has traditionally been characterized by a focus on surface appearances and a lack of concern for deeper meanings and underlying truths. This is seen in the way that traditional Japanese art and culture emphasizes visual beauty and simplicity, often to the exclusion of more complex and nuanced themes.

Murakami sees the rise of the otaku subculture as a manifestation of this tendency towards superflatness. He argues that the otaku, with their obsession with anime, manga, and other forms of popular culture, are drawn to the surface-level pleasures of these media, without engaging with their deeper meanings and messages. This, he suggests, is a reflection of the broader cultural phenomenon of superflatness in Japan.

Murakami's work often engages with the concept of superflatness, using it as a lens through which to critique and explore contemporary Japanese society. His art often incorporates elements of anime and manga, as well as other aspects of popular culture, in order to comment on the superficiality and lack of depth that he sees as characteristic of Japanese society.


### The Concept of Multiplicity in an Egoless Internet as potentialization of Superflatness


Multiplicity is a concept that describes the way that reality is composed of multiple and diverse elements that coexist and intersect in complex and unpredictable ways. This view of reality challenges the traditional notion of the self as a stable and coherent entity, instead suggesting that the self is a fluid and ever-changing assemblage of elements that are constantly in flux.

The internet, with its vast and ever-expanding network of information and communication, has made it possible for individuals to explore and express a multitude of identities and perspectives in a way that was not previously possible in a total "egoless" space, where individuals are able to shed their traditional identities and roles and to explore new and different ways of being. 

In this way, the internet has become a potentialization of the concept of superflatness, allowing individuals to explore the surface-level pleasures of internet experience and develop experiences integrated to the digital realm without being constrained by the expectations and norms of mainstream society or limitations of their real personas. This has created a sense of fluidity, where individuals are able to explore multiple identities and perspectives, and to connect with others in a variety of ways.

[^1]: The post-war Japanese constitution's Article 9, which renounces war and prohibits the maintenance of armed forces, has long been a source of debate and controversy. However, in recent years, the article has been reinterpreted to allow for Japan's participation in warfare alongside the United States.

    This reinterpretation came to the forefront during the Iraq War, when Japan sent a self-defense force to provide non-combat support to American forces. This marked a significant shift in Japan's pacifist stance, and raised questions about the limitations of Article 9.

    Critics argue that this reinterpretation undermines the spirit of the constitution and puts Japan at risk of being drawn into conflicts that do not directly threaten its security. They argue that Japan should remain committed to its pacifist principles and avoid involvement in foreign wars.

    Supporters of the reinterpretation, on the other hand, argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in international security, particularly in light of the growing threat from North Korea and China. They argue that Japan must be willing to defend itself and its allies, and that the self-defense force is capable of doing so without violating the constitution.

[^2]: The arrest of Tsutomu Miyazaki in 1989 sparked a media frenzy and moral panic in Japan, as the public learned of the gruesome details of his crimes. Miyazaki, a young man who was known to be an otaku and a fan of lolicon manga, had kidnapped and murdered four young girls, committing sexual acts with their corpses. The discovery of his extensive collection of horror and lolicon manga in his room led many to speculate that these materials had influenced his behavior and contributed to his criminal actions. This sparked a national debate about the dangers of the otaku subculture and the potential harmful effects of lolicon manga. While some called for stricter regulations on these materials, others defended the right of otaku to express themselves freely through their art and entertainment.
    
    Another example is the Tokyo subway sarin attack, also known as the Tokyo subway gas attack, occurred when members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult released sarin gas on five trains on the Tokyo subway system during the morning rush hour. The attack killed 12 people and injured thousands, and was one of the most serious terrorist incidents in Japanese history. The leader of the cult, Shoko Asahara, was a self-proclaimed otaku who had been heavily influenced by anime and manga. Some have speculated that the otaku subculture may have played a role in the development of his extremist views and the decision to carry out the attack.
