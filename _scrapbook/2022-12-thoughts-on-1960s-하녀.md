# Topoanalysis in "The Handmaiden" 

![](../images/housemade%200.png)

## Gaston Bachelard's philosophy of the home

The psychological effects of architecture on the human mind are profound and multifaceted. Gaston Bachelard in "poetics of space" suggests that the spaces we inhabit have the ability to evoke deep-seated emotional responses, shaping our psychological experience.

One of the key concepts in Bachelard's philosophy is the idea of "intimate immensity" **DEFINITION** 

These psychological responses are not only influenced by the size and scale of a space, but also by its materiality. Bachelard's concept of "topoanalysis" **how this relates to the house in the housemaid**

But it is not only the physical aspects of a space that impact our psychological experience. To Bachelard, certain spaces have the ability to transport us into a state of imaginative contemplation, allowing us to access our innermost thoughts and desires. A grand, open space with high ceilings and natural light may evoke a sense of freedom and limitless possibility, while a cozy nook with comfortable furnishings may inspire feelings of safety and serenity.

## The home as a psychological space in The Housemaid

The home in The Housemaid can be only seen as a dungeon, a dangerous labyrinthic place where the psychological impact on the inhabitants can only be draining. The cold, oppressive atmosphere and the rough, unforgiving materials of such a space create a feeling of claustrophobia and entrapment, making it difficult for the inhabitants or the viewer to feel at ease when the characters are portrayed at home.

The dark, dank atmosphere and the constant rainfall creates a feeling of isolation and disconnecion from the outside world. The surreal, disorienting elements of the space, such as the stony walls and faces of statues, the bizarre amount of paintings, and the disorganized mobilia, only add to the feeling of disorientation.

The cold, unforgiving surfaces of the dungeon-like house create a feeling of harshness, evoking a sense of abandonment. The rough, jagged edges of the materials used in the construction of the new house add to the feeling of instability and insecurity, making it difficult for the house to make the viewer feel safe and secure.

The bleak, uninviting atmosphere of a dungeon-like house led by the oppressive, confined feelings evoke anxiety and discomfort, making it difficult for the inhabitants to feel at ease, and such uneasiness work as the catalyst for the major events that occur in the second act of the movie, as an outsider that presents a constant easiness in this realm shows up.
