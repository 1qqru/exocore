taking this day to go through a few notes on movies. these small thoughts are laying somewhere in my mind to be developed in the future, but for now I'd like to expose them just so I don't forget them and maybe in the future I can use them as prompt for something bigger if I ever feel the need to.

### Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood 1985

Hideshi Hino's "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a disturbingly raw and visceral exploration of the grotesque. With his camera, Hino masterfully captures the disturbing process of dismemberment, delving deep into the twisted imagination of a mad artisan. The film is devoid of any kind of moral justification or plot, leaving the viewer to confront the disturbing images head-on. The butcher, the embodiment of Hino's twisted vision, stares directly into the camera, inviting the voyeuristic audience to bear witness to his grotesque creations. This is not a film for the faint of heart, but for those daring enough to face the darkest depths of human depravity, "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a disturbingly powerful and cathartic experience.

### Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade 1999

Jin-Roh is a haunting exploration of the eternal conflict between order and chaos. Set in a dystopian Japan, the film portrays a society on the brink of collapse, where even a glimmer of empathy is punished. The wolves, representing the relentless pursuit of order, are trained to kill without hesitation. But as our hero, Fuse, struggles with his own humanity, he begins to question the true cost of this supposed order. The ending is a chilling reminder of the dangers of blindly following authority. Jin-Roh is a powerful and poetic tale of the human condition, a haunting reminder of the price of order at all costs.
