i plan on making a few posts on my journal regarding my favorite movies. I'll start soon with 1960's ‘하녀’ :)

i also saw [memory_prism's neocities](https://memory-prism.neocities.org/) today and he has a poetry challenge i thought i should try. the prompt was the following:

Choose a memory. It can be something from your childhood or something recent, it doesn’t matter. Close your eyes and think of this memory. When you have it write for 2 minutes on each of the following: -In the memory, i see…(2 minutes); In the memory, i hear…(2 minutes) ,In the memory, i feel…(2 minutes) ,In the memory, i smell…(2 minutes) ,In the memory, i taste…(2 minutes)

as moonlight bathes his face,
the chasm below us yawns.
his voice, a desperate mumble,
i can hear a few cars pass us by.

i stand, my soul numb,
watching as he falls into the nights.
he didn't wait for me,
his thoughts consumed by madness.

a train may come,
to carry him away from this place.
but I am sorry, I cannot feel,
for what has happened here.

all I feel,
the smell of blood.
my shirt stained,
memories lost.
