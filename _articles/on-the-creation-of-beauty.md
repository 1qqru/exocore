1. Beauty is a manifestation of Nature's inherent spirit, stemming from its creative tendency;
2. Like time and space, Beauty is a property of Nature that exists independently of any individual's relationship to it;
3. As a property of Nature, Beauty cannot be contradictory; it cannot be both ugly and beautiful;
4. Beauty pre-exists the emergence of intelligence.

Nature has designed all forms through the medium of Beauty, resulting in harmonious arrangements within the world. Some of these forms are more expressive of Beauty's presence, possessing traits that constantly remind us of its existence. These traits can be seen as fingerprints of Nature, embedded in every creation and allowing for the recreation of Nature's creative process through Art. However, when these traits are organized and manipulated for negative purposes, they can confuse and depress the spirit, resulting in Non-Art - a calculated tendency towards subjectivity and destruction.

Non-Art, as a mere simulacrum of creation, is inauthentic, while Art - the eternal recomposition of Beauty - is authentic, clear, and cathartic. The intelligent mind is instinctively drawn towards Art, embracing it as if it were a contingent act of Nature's creative process itself. This is because Art possesses certain objective aesthetic properties - it is sublime, beneficial, and miraculous.

I believe that the failure of correlationism allows us to recognize the objective existence of Beauty as a property of Nature. Unlike correlationism, which posits that reality is constructed by the subject, I argue that Beauty exists independently of any individual's relationship to it. This allows us to understand Beauty as an inherent aspect of Nature, one that precedes the emergence of intelligence and is guided by the eternal recomposition of Beauty.

Art is beautiful because it is a recreation of Nature's beauty, a constant symphony. The creation of art reveals the link between the various dimensions of intelligent thought, such as time, space, reality, and rationality, and contains a kind of beautification stemming from a primordial orchestration. This connection to its origin cannot be completely obstructed, and non-art can never truly capture it. This connection is free from the misguided notion that "the best art is that of the old ones, the classical art," because Nature's influence is the permanent foundation of the world and brings the intelligent mind to its best state, closer to its pre-existence.

When we attempt to understand Nature's tendency towards creation, we see that it is the great imagination of "something." This imagination is most powerfully captured in visual arts, allowing the creation to "see" its light, and in music, allowing the creation to "hear" its hymns.

Everything that exists and happens in the world can be expanded, remade, and revealed through art. Beauty belongs to the original architecture of the temple and every subsequent restructuring, as the temple belongs to it and not the other way around.
