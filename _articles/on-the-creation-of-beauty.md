1. Beauty is a manifestation of Nature's inherent spirit, stemming from its creative tendency;
2. Like time and space, Beauty is a property of Nature that exists independently of any individual's relationship to it;
3. As a property of Nature, Beauty cannot be contradictory; it cannot be both ugly and beautiful;
4. Beauty pre-exists the emergence of intelligence.[^1]

Nature has designed all forms through the medium of Beauty, resulting in harmonious arrangements within the world. Some of these forms are more expressive of Beauty's presence, possessing traits that constantly remind us of its existence. These traits can be seen as fingerprints of Nature, embedded in every creation and allowing for the recreation of Nature's creative process through Art. However, when these traits are organized and manipulated for negative purposes, they can confuse and depress the spirit, resulting in Non-Art - a calculated tendency towards subjectivity and destruction.

Non-Art, as a mere simulacrum of creation, is inauthentic, while Art - the eternal recomposition of Beauty - is authentic, clear, and cathartic. The intelligent mind is instinctively drawn towards Art, embracing it as if it were a contingent act of Nature's creative process itself. This is because Art possesses certain objective aesthetic properties - it is sublime, beneficial, and miraculous.

I believe that the failure of correlationism allows us to recognize the objective existence of Beauty as a property of Nature. Unlike correlationism, which posits that reality is constructed by the subject, I argue that Beauty exists independently of any individual's relationship to it. This allows us to understand Beauty as an inherent aspect of Nature, one that precedes the emergence of intelligence[^2] and is guided by the eternal recomposition of Beauty.

Art is beautiful because it is a recreation of Nature's beauty, a constant symphony. The creation of art reveals the link between the various dimensions of intelligent thought, such as time, space, reality, and rationality, and contains a kind of beautification stemming from a primordial orchestration. This connection to its origin cannot be completely obstructed, and non-art can never truly capture it. This connection is free from fiendish assertions such as "The best Art is that of the old ones, the classical Art", because Nature's influence is the permanent foundation of the world - which transports the intelligent mind to its best state, closer to what was before itself became: both when it creates through Nature and when it is created by it.

When we attempt to understand Nature's tendency towards creation, we see that it is the great imagination of "something." This imagination is most powerfully captured in visual arts, allowing the creation to "see" its light, and in music, allowing the creation to "hear" its hymns.

Everything that exists and happens in the world can be expanded, remade, and revealed through art. Beauty belongs to the original architecture of the temple and every subsequent restructuring, as the temple belongs to it and not the other way around.

[^1]: Denying this is fundamentally correlationism. It is assuming that our understanding of the world is always shaped by our relationship to it. This means we can't access creativity directly, only through factors like human cognition and creative expression. The fragility of correlationism lays on the fact that we can fathom information/data from before intelligent life and that we're able to assume data from post intelligent life. We're not creative, we're just interacting with creativity's interface. 

    As a proponent of object-oriented ontology, I believe that denying the existence of creativity independent of human cognition is fundamentally correlationist. This is because it assumes that our understanding of the world is always shaped by our relationship to it, and that we cannot access creativity directly. Instead, we can only access it through factors like human cognition and creative expression. The fragility of this correlationist perspective lies in the fact that we can imagine and conceptualize information and data from before the existence of intelligent life, as well as from after the demise of intelligent life. This suggests that creativity exists independently of human consciousness. Therefore, we are not truly creative, but rather are simply interacting with creativity's interface.

    In the context of object-oriented ontology, this idea can be seen as a rejection of the notion that we are the ultimate source of meaning and value in the world. Instead, it suggests that creativity is an inherent quality of the world itself, and that our own creativity is a product of our interactions with this fundamental creative force. This aligns with the OOO perspective, which sees all objects as having their own agency and value, independent of our perception of them.

[^2]: The concept of the "arche-fossil" was developed by French philosopher Quentin Meilassoux in his book After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency. In this book, Meilassoux argues that human thought is limited by our reliance on the principle of sufficient reason, which states that every phenomenon must have a cause. However, Meilassoux contends that this principle is not applicable to the realm of the "ancestral," or events that occurred prior to the emergence of terrestrial life.

    The concept of the arche-fossil is used by Meilassoux to refer to an object that serves as evidence of the existence of such an ancestral reality or event. This could be something as simple as a rock or a piece of fossilized bone, but Meilassoux suggests that it could also be more complex structures, such as mathematical equations or certain types of art.

    In Meilassoux's view, the arche-fossil serves as a bridge between the human world and the ancestral realm. By providing tangible evidence of the existence of this realm, the arche-fossil allows us to access and study events that occurred before the emergence of terrestrial life. This opens up new possibilities for understanding the universe and its origins, and allows us to move beyond the limitations imposed by the principle of sufficient reason and contingency.
