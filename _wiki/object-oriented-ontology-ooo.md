# Object Oriented Ontology (OOO)

The concept of Object Oriented Ontology (OOO) is a philosophical approach that emphasizes the ontological primacy of individual objects and their inherent qualities and relations, rather than abstract concepts or universal principles. This perspective challenges traditional metaphysical models that prioritize the subject-object dichotomy and the idea of a single, overarching reality.

OOO is often associated with the work of philosopher Graham Harman, who developed the concept in his book "Objects and Relations" (2007) and expanded upon it in subsequent writings. Harman's OOO theory is heavily influenced by the work of Martin Heidegger and Alfred North Whitehead, and incorporates ideas from post-structuralism and critical realism.

The central tenet of OOO is that objects have irreducible qualities and relationships that are not reducible to the subjective experiences or interpretations of human subjects. This means that objects exist independently of human perception, and that their inherent qualities and relations cannot be fully understood or explained through human cognition or language. OOO therefore rejects the idea of a single, objective reality that can be known or represented by human subjects, and instead posits a multiplicity of ontological domains or "worlds" that are constituted by individual objects and their relations.

OOO has been applied in a variety of fields, including philosophy, art, architecture, and media studies. It has been used as a framework for understanding the ontological status of non-human entities, such as animals, plants, and artifacts, and for exploring the implications of this perspective for issues such as ethics, politics, and the environment. Critics of OOO have argued that it is overly individualistic and fails to account for the interconnectedness and interdependence of objects within complex systems.
