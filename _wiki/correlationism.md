Correlationism is a philosophical concept developed by French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux. It refers to the idea that the relationship between the human mind and the external world is necessary for the existence and understanding of both. This concept has been widely discussed in the field of continental philosophy.

According to Meillassoux, correlationism is a form of subjectivism that posits that the subject is always involved in the process of understanding the world. This means that our understanding of the world is always mediated by our human perspective, and that the external world cannot be known in and of itself.

Meillassoux argues that this approach is problematic because it makes it impossible to know anything about the world outside of our human experience. He contends that this leads to a form of skepticism that undermines our ability to make claims about the world and to engage in meaningful philosophical inquiry.

In his book "After Finitude," Meillassoux offers a critique of correlationism and proposes an alternative approach to understanding the world. He suggests that we can have knowledge of the world that is independent of our human perspective, and that this knowledge is accessible through the use of mathematical and scientific methods.

Overall, the concept of correlationism has been an important and influential idea in contemporary philosophy, and has sparked a great deal of debate and discussion among philosophers.
