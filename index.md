## Wake-up Call

One day I overheard two drunk guys talking on the street while I was going to a grocery shop to buy a monster energy drink:

"Will the 'great cannibal-liturgical buffet' take place this very week? does it give the necrofiscal elite time to all gather around the 'food'?"

Then I realized what this was about. **It is about deliberately sawing off portions of our psyches and identities limb by limb before they do it to us.**
