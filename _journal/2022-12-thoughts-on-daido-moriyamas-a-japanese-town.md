# Thoughts on Daido Moriyama's "A Japanese

![](/images/a_japanese_town.jpg)

Society, in its very essence, has degenerative condition, but despite this, many have attempted to explore its depths. One notable figure in this regard is Daido Moriyama, whose work "A Japanese Town" stands out as a testament to the reactive impulses of sensuality, the potency of gruesome bursts, and the erotic essence that is so characteristic of his non-labored workflow.

Moriyama's photography is a raw and imperfect reflection of an erotic space, devoid of soul and respect, that is saturated with visual squalor. His work is a deviation from the norm, a limit-pushing exploration of the approximation between the dominant entity of the camera and the human reaction to hide in the empty blackness of "somewhere else".

In the documentary Near Equal [^1], fellow Japanese photographer Araki offers insight into Moriyama's work, stating that "the photographer had been a slave of the camera for a long time. Good camera, good lens, etc. These were the masters of a photographer. But in a way, Daido Moriyama is a photographer who started to make the camera his own slave. Photography is not about the camera. If you want to write a romantic love letter, you need some tool to write it with. But anything â€“ a pencil or a ball pen is fine. It is like this in photography."

Within the ever-evolving landscape of photography, it is not uncommon for artists to reject the traditional methods of creation. These outsiders often operate in a juxtaposition of space and time, producing work that is both unique and captivating, much like the work of Daido Moriyama.

What makes Moriyama such an interesting figure is the transcendent ethos that permeates his work, revealing the artist behind the negligent facade. Few can capture such a profound essence within a single frame.

Moriyama's "A Japanese Town" is a masterful example of his ability to push the boundaries of traditional photography, creating a provocative and engaging piece that is both raw and sensual. The use of saturation and visual squalor imbues the work with a sense of unease, while the lack of effort in the composition reveals a raw and imperfect aesthetic.

In this way, Moriyama's work is a rejection of the typical expectations of photography, and instead, offers a glimpse into a world that is both chaotic and alluring. His ability to make the camera his own slave, rather than being a slave to it, is a testament to his skill and creativity, and serves as a reminder that photography is not just about the tools, but about the vision of the artist.

In conclusion, Daido Moriyama's "A Japanese Town" is a powerful and provocative work that challenges traditional notions of photography, and offers a glimpse into the chaotic and sensual world of the artist. Its raw and imperfect aesthetic, combined with its transcendent ethos, make it a must-see for fans of provocative and engaging photography.
